#EmotionBot
Little chatbot with emotion detection

This is a personal project, to use it you must use python and the libraries used in it must be installed. It uses the OpenAI API so you need a key to use it.

-- Upcoming improvements --
Code optimization.
Simultaneity of start and end.
Visual interface.
Avatar for the TTS.

Thanks for checking it out
